Logging Demo Module

Note: This Module uses Prism.Plugin.Popups which relies on Rg.Plugins.Popup. You will need to initialize Rg.Plugins.Popup on each of your target platforms. If you are relying on having a functioning ILoggerFacade or ILogger in your application this Module must be added with an Initialization Mode of `WhenAvailable`.
